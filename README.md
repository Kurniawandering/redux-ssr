## Install

Due to the dependency on `babel-register`, this starter-kit works only with node version >= 5.x

```
npm install nodemon -g
npm install
```

Usage in development:
```
npm run dev
```
Usage in production:
```
npm start
```
To build assets for production:
```
npm run build
```
To build stats.json, in order to analyse the app with webpack module analyzer
```
npm run stats
```
